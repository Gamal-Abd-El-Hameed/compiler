CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /media/gamal/New Volume/semester/compilers/project/compiler/cmake-build-debug/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /media/gamal/New Volume/semester/compilers/project/LexicalAnalyzerGenerator/cmake-build-debug where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/media/gamal/New Volume/semester/compilers/project/compiler/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/media/gamal/New Volume/semester/compilers/project/LexicalAnalyzerGenerator/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
